# Welcome to AGPMaker-Help v2
This is the source for the Help Files of AGPMaker.v2 which gets wrapped up into a package which is what is used to implement the Help.  This prevents us from having to rebuild the help everything we are creating a new build.  Instead this help file is created any time that there is a change in the documentation.

Any notes on how to build this package will be detailed on these pages.  This will of course include install instructions and any dependencies that need to be taken care of before we can even get this to run.
